A Discord Bot that has some special functions. Like screaming.

Hello. Im a high school student and this is a Bot I made for learning purposses since I'm getting into programming as a whole.
If you want to see it for yourself you are free to do that and if you want you can give me suggestions for improvement.

The commands of the Bot are commented but still I'm going to write them down here. The default prefix is "%".
- help
- info (Is changable in the config)
- songvolume [percentage]

To get it running, you need node.js 14.0.0 with the following packages and their dependencies: 
- youtube-search by MaxGfeller,
- ytdl-core by fent,
- discord.js.

You will also need a .env file to put in the tokens:
- DISCORD_TOKEN (The Discord app token),
- YOUTUBE_API (The Google API token).

You are allowed to freely edit the Code.
